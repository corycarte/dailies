# Problem - Given two binary numbers represented as strings,
#           return the sum of the two binary numbers as a new binary represented as a string.
#           Do this without converting the whole binary string into an integer.

def sum_binary(bin1, bin2):
    # complete function here
    # personal challenge, give recursive solution
    print('start')


# Test Code
print(sum_binary('11101', '1011'))
# 10100
print(sum_binary('00000', '1111'))
# 1111
print(sum_binary('', '1011'))
# 1011
